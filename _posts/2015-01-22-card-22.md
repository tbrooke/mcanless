Moonshine money, an abandoned shack-that's not empty, rusty lock boxes, strangers who aren't who they say they are--and Confederate dollars. Jan McCanless is at it again with Steve, Suzanne, Rainey and Phil. This time they are on the hunt of a buried treasure, unaware that a killer is stalking them, planning to make the treasure his.
