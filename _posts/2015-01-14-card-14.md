Promote yourself. If you can't believe in your writing, how can you possibly expect anyone else to believe in it? Think about this, if you've gotten so far as to get something published, then, there must be something redemptive about your writing. Shore up your self-confidence, and go forth and promote! The more public appearances you make, the better you'll be, and like they always say, practice makes perfect. That's why it's so important to write about what you know, what you're passionate about. It's easy to talk about something you feel strongly about, and remember this too, anyone showing up at your book signing, or personal appearance, is there to see YOU, so, give it all you got!! Thus writes Jan Mccanless in this small book in which she shares those secrets that have helped her sell thousands of her wonderful books.
