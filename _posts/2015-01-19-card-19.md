From darkest Africa, blood diamonds are mined and shipped to  unscrupulous dealers around the world.  Once in New York, a black listed dealer steals not only the diamonds, but the money used to buy them, and skips town. Somehow, he ends up in Beryl's Cove, where he tries desperately  to get enough money to escape the 'little burg', as he calls it.  Suddenly, dead bodies  turn up, and townspeaople end up disappearing. 

A real puzzlement for our haggard police chief, Nathan Sowinski, and our two amateur sleuths. Busy with the the new wine bar that Suzanne has installed, STeve and the chief try to solve the mystery of the missing diamond thief, and the kidnapped citizens. 

Old favorites return in this latest installment of the Beryl's Cove mystery series, with some surprises thrown in .  Dawg and Elvis are at their most charming best, as they once again enchant readers of this beloved series."
