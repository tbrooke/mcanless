“Darling, has the whole world gone crazy?” Steve asks. “No, Sweetheart, just our little corner of it.” So goes the sentiment, all the while frustrating Chief Nathan Sowinski and putting his job on the line. It’s all too much for him as a private yacht sinks off the coast of Beryl’s Cove, and the adventure begins. A federal agent being chased by other agents, vandalism in the campground, all the while poor Pastor Kapas tries diligently to put the Christmas Pageant together. Skullduggery and deceit are the fare of the day, in this, another hilarious romp from the beach bunch of Pykes County. Dawg and Elvis are always their charming selves, plus a few whacky characters that cross paths with our amateur sleuths, Steve and Suzanne Thomas. Come on along for the ride of a lifetime!
