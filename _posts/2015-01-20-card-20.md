The Stateline Motel sits right on the borders of Florida and Georgia ,and has seen much better days. Owned and operated by father and daughter, Bud and Jimmie Turner, nothing much happens there, and nobody stays there, anymore. That is, until one day, a tour bus full of New Yorkers veers far off course, and breaks down up the road from the motel.

Angry and quarrelsome, the bus riders are stranded at the Stateline, until a substitute bus and driver show up. They hate the place, is like one another, and can't seem to get along, and thenâ€”a murder within the group. A friendly group of locals, along with the amiable sheriff set to work to solve the crime, and catch the murderer, who is surely one of the New Yorkers, all the while, a giant, menacing alligator is keeping them all cooped up inside.

Come along for another bumpy ride and, and, meet a new cast of characters from inventive mystery author, Jan McCanless.
