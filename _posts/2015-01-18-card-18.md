The best-selling author, speaker--and keen observer of life in the new century--writes with humor, joy, nostalgia and hope from keen insights she gained in the last century. In Bizarre Brain Drippings, Jan McCanless uses a series of reminiscences, observations and editorial comments to marvelously chronicle the changes she has experienced. She describes the hilarious and the poignant, the outrageous and the sublime. An acute observer, she writes with self-deprecating wit and sharp awareness. When we have finished these many short pieces, compiled from years of thoughtful journaling, we only wish she had more thoughts to share.
