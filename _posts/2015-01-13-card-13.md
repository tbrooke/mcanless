That delightful bunch from Beryl’s Cover, NC, is back. This time Suzanne’s college reunion is coming up, and it promises to be exciting. All the grads will be taking a train excursion from the coast all the way through the Midwest to Chicago. Instead of the sightseeing and revelry they planned, however, the alumni are confronted with murder most foul. Amateur sleuth Steve Thomas, ably assisted by his gorgeous wife, realize they must solve this case and clear up the mystery, as multiple passengers go missing and the train inexplicably slows to a crawl.
