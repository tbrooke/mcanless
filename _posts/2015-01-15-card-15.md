The Rising Son Temple of Peace has taken up residence in Beryl's Cove, and the citizens are in an uproar. It's a cult they all proclaim, and they don't need that sort in town.
They don't know what to do about it, or how to get rid of them, and once dead bodies begin turning up the entire citizenry is in a rage, eventually even turning on poor Suzanne Thomas who owns the building that they use for their temple.
Follow the action as our amateur married sleuths, along with Police Chief Nathan Sowinski as they attempt to find the murderers and get rid of the cult all at the same time. Once a suspicious fire burns the Temple down, it would appear that some of the locals made good on their attempt to run them out of town. 
The action of Murder for the Profit will take you from sleepy Beryl's cove right up the eastern shore of Delaware as Sowinski and Steve close in on the perpetrators.
Don't miss any of the action in the latest Beryl's Cove murder mystery, with all your favorite Cove citizens, including the irrepressible Dawg and Elvis.
