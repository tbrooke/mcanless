I"ï<p>That Berylâ€™s Cove bunch is back, this time in Las Vegas, where Steve and Suzanne are celebrating their wedding anniversary at the Mexicali Casino and Resort. Running into an old Navy buddy of Steveâ€™s, they are called on to help solve another mystery when a dead body is discovered in a closet on the twelfth floor of the hotel.</p>

<p>They cross paths with Russian spies, double agents, and one very nasty CIA man. National Security could be involved unless they can beat the clock and solve the case. Soon more bodies turn up, and the local police work with our aging, out-of-shape and out-of-breath characters to solve the murders.</p>

<p>Exciting and intriguing, come along for another amusing high adventure you wonâ€™t want to miss!</p>
