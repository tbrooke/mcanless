I"D<p>Who is stealing from the church in Beryl’s Cove, Mariner’s Chapel? Could it be a ghost wandering around the building and the underground caves that have been there since civil war days, or is it one of the many tourists in town for the summer.</p>

<p>Things disappear, pockets are picked and the police in this quiet Mecca are stumped. Calling on amateur sleuths and married couple, Steve and Suzanne Thomas, the plot thickens with confusion as to just why the Brown twins think they need an assisted living facility and why has the church’s sexton turned up murdered in broad daylight?</p>

<p>More exciting hi-jinks are in this latest installment of the Beryl’s Cove mysteries. So come along to coastal North Carolina and join the fun as the action takes us from Beryl’s Cove to the streets of Melbourne, Australia.</p>
