I"Å<p>Welcome to Janâ€™s World, a land of offbeat characters, quirky relatives, and unusual happenings and events that have shaped and patterned author Janet McCanlessâ€™s world for many years now. In Wyatt Earp, G.A.P. Pickles and Thoughts of Home, she writes lovingly of the many, many people she has encountered, known for years, or by happenstance, she is related to in a way that will make you laugh, cry, or wonder aloud about. Her beloved South is not left unscathed either, and you will swear the same thing happened to you once as you read this delightful compilation of her newspaper columns, her magazine articles, and her humor presentations around the country. Why shed a tear, when laughing is so much more fun and easier on the brain, is her motto, and she never met an incident she could not find humor in. Come on along for the ride of a lifetime, and be prepared to be uproariously entertained and taught a few of lifeâ€™s lessons along the way!</p>
